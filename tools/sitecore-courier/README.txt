Since Sitecore Courier has no proper release management and we need some extra features,
we use a custom build here.

Custom features:
- New command line option '-collisionBehavior' with possible values force, skip and undefined
- All file system folders are excluced

The current binaries are a release build of the commit 82aea7b60d
(https://github.com/unic/Sitecore-Courier/tree/unicMaster)
